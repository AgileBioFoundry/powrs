POWRs requires

- Python 2.6 or newer (www.python.org)
- Numpy 1.5 or newer  (www.scipy.org)
- Scipy 0.8 or newer  (www.scipy.org)
- a Unix-like environment, such as Linux or Mac OS X

These days, the easiest way to get these dependencies may be the
free Anaconda system, provided by http://continuum.io/.  It may even
work on Windows, but we haven't tested it, and you'll still have to
build libRmath and libDivSufSort yourself -- see below.

Building Numpy and Scipy from source can be challenging, but most
systems have precompiled binaries available. Windows (cygwin) is not
currently supported, because Scipy will not build for us. We recommend
that Windows users run POWRS inside a Linux virtual machine. For
example, VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org) and Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com) are
both freely available and easy to use.

POWRS also uses two C libraries. We have pre-packaged binaries of
these libraries for Linux (64-bit Ubuntu / Linux Mint) and
Mac OS X (64-bit OS X 10.6.8 "Snow Leopard"). If these binaries do not
work for you, follow the directions below to compile for your system
and replace the pre-packaged binaries. If you get a "wrong ELF class"
error from Python, you have a 32-bit / 64-bit mismatch between Python
and the libraries, and will need to recompile the libraries or use a
different machine.



Mac OS X
========

On Mac OS X, we tested with the MacPorts (www.macports.org) versions of
Python, Numpy, and Scipy:

    sudo port install py27-scipy cmake

Mac OS X also needs help in finding the shared C libraries
(libdivsufsort.dylib and libRmath.dylib). Either copy them to somewhere
on your shared library search path (like /usr/local/lib), or add them to
your DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/my/path/to/POWRS/pygr:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"

Replace "/my/path/to/POWRS" with whatever is appropriate for your
system. Also, you must either run this command each time you open a new
Terminal, before running POWRS; or add it to e.g. your ~/.bash_profile.



libRmath    http://cran.r-project.org/
======================================

After downloading the R source code from CRAN, unpack it and do:

    ./configure --enable-R-static-lib --enable-static --with-readline=no
    cd src/nmath/standalone/
    make
    cp libRmath.so ~/POWRS/pygr/



libDivSufSort    http://code.google.com/p/libdivsufsort/
========================================================

Get libdivsufsort 2.0.1 or later, unpack it, and:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ccmake ..  # accept default settings
    make
    cp libs/libdivsufsort.so ~/POWRS/pygr/
